# Monte-Carlo-Option-Pricing
A Monte Carlo simulation that calculates Call and Put Option prices given a Strike Price. Stock ticker, strike price, and length of simulation are all adjustable.

This program is written in Jupyter.

In the 1970s, the Black-Scholes equation was created and solved to accurately price option contracts. Certain assumptions were part of the equation and solutions, which are not always accurate in real life. A Monte Carlo simulation, while much more computationally expensive, allows the user to adjust for different scenarios which are not friendly when solving for analytical solutions. These scenarios are not explored here in this file, but it is open to adjustment.
